Marijn Haverbeke's "Eloquent JavaScript"

I like the quotes in the book, and that the example projects are assigned with no code samples.  So you are encouraged to produce your own works.

There's game building, there's fractals, there's very good descriptions of the abstractions of JavaScript in a way that sticks with me.

Note the availability of generic e-reader copies for a low carbon footprint.  Also note that they aren't tied to proprietary e-reader platforms.  I like that.
