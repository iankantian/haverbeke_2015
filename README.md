Marijn Haverbeke's "Eloquent JavaScript"

These examples are my work, so any errors you can presume to be my fault.

To see the work you have to go to the directory in your Terminal and type: 'npm install' and then 'gulp' to build the samples.  Then open up 'index.html' in a browser.

I like the quotes in the book, and that the example projects are assigned with no code samples.  So you are encouraged to produce your own works.

There's game building, there's fractals, there's very good descriptions of the abstractions of JavaScript in a way that sticks with me.

Note the availability of generic e-reader copies for a low carbon footprint.  Also note that they aren't tied to proprietary e-reader platforms.  I like that.
